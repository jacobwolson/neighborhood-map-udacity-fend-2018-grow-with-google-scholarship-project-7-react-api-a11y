# Neighborhoods Map | Udacity FEND | 2018

Project 7 for Udacity's Front End Web Developer Nanodegree; completed as part of the Grow with Google Scholarship program, 2018.

<br><br>
## Authors

I — Jacob W. Olson — built this app from scratch based on my knowledge gained through Udacity's course and assistance, knowledge and techniques from various sources noted throughout the code. 

Project coach Doug Brown's walkthrough was also a particularly instructive resourse. As a general overviews and outlines for creating a single page application with React incorporating Google Maps, articles by [Rachel Njeri](https://scotch.io/tutorials/react-apps-with-the-google-maps-api-and-google-maps-react) and [by Ari Lerner](https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/how-to-write-a-google-maps-react-component/), as referenced in `LocationsDisplay.js`, were of great value and use. Many other sources that were invaluable are noted throughout the code. And I could not have done it without the support of my fellow Grow with Google scholars and the wider programming community.

## Getting the App Up and Running

1. Create a local directory on your machine and clone the repository to it. For help with this step, see [this tutorial from GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/ "GitHub Help — Clone a Repository").

2. Make sure you have node.js and npm installed. 
    * To check for node.js, open a command window and enter "node -v" in the command line. If node is installed, a version number should be returned: e.g., "v8.11.3." 
    * To check for npm, enter "npm -v." If npm is installed, you should likewise see a version number returned: e.g., "6.4.1."
    * If you do not have node and npm installed, you may wish follow [these instructions from Dave McFarland at Treehouse](https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-windows "How to Install Node.js® and NPM on Windows" by Dave McFarland) to get them going on your machine.
    * To learn more about node.js and npm, you may wish to check out the linked article from Treehouse above, see [this article by Priyash Patel on freeCodeCamp's blog](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/what-exactly-is-node-js-ae36e97449f5 ""What exactly is Node.js?" by Priyesh Patel"), take a look around [the node.js website](https://node.js.org/en/ "Node.js website) or at any other of the many awesome resources for learning out there. 

3. With node.js and npm installed, you'll next want to install the application's dependencies. 
    * Run `npm install` on the command line, and wait for the installation process to complete.

4. Next, fire up the development server.
    * Enter `npm start` on the command line. After a short time, a browser window with the URL "https:localhost:3000" should open, displaying the app. You can navigate to this URL as well.

5. You should now be able to check out the app and it's features!

## Dependencies

- [creat-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- [google-maps-react](https://github.com/fullstackreact/google-maps-react)
- [sort-by](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sort-by)

## More info as provided by create-react-app.

            This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

            ## Available Scripts

            In the project directory, you can run:

            ### `npm start`

            Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
            Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

            The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
            You will also see any lint errors in the console.

            ### `npm test`

            Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
            See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

            ### `npm run build`

            Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
            It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

            The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
            Your app is ready to be deployed!

            See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

            ### `npm run eject`

            **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

            If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

            Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

            You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
